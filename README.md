# django-vue 
## overview
django-vue is a social media platform similar to Instagram, developed using Django for the backend, Vue.js for the web frontend, and Flutter for the mobile frontend. The application allows users to follow each other, view profiles, create posts, join groups, and engage in private chats. The chat functionality includes features like replying to messages, sending images, and setting group admins. Note that this project is still under development and is not yet feature-complete.
